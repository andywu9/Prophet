        <div class="w3-container">
         <p>Prophet came to be as a project for Software Design and Documentation, a course taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. For this course, groups would have to design a project of their choice. The HODLers, the name of our group, decided to do a project around cryptocurrency since it was a hot topic at the start of the project. Our initial idea centered around making a website where users could log in, have access to their crypto, and trade with the many different exchanges. This idea became a little above our heads when we were discussing the privacy and issues of holding users many different coins and money.
         </p>
         <p>This led us to pivot to the current Prophet that we have today, a predictive algorithm for the crypto world using machine learning. Andy Wu and Adam Lawrence were already very familiar with the crypto world while Mike Adams, Igor Carvalho, and Jeremy Torella had limited experience but were open to learning.

        <h1 class="w3-text-blue w3-padding-16"><i class="w3-margin-right"></i>Why Open Source</h1>
        <div class="w3-container">
         <p>We decided to create this project with the hopes that it would further the progress in the field of machine learning, as it relates to cryptocurrency. We believe that the advancement in this field would be most efficient if we allowed the website to be open source. As an open source project, this website becomes a platform for others to test their ideas regarding predictive ML algorithms and allows a community to form around predicting cryptocurrency price changes.

        <div class="w3-container">
         <p>Prophet currently uses two algorithms for price forecasts: linear regression and an LSTM, long short-term memory, neural network. A linear regression is a line that best fits the prices between a starting price and an ending price. We use linear regression to forecast trend directions which helps users determine when to buy and when to sell their cryptocurrencies. An LSTM neural network is a variant of an RNN, recurrent neural network, and is a model for short-term memory which can last over a long period of time. It allows us to chain outputs from one step of our neural network, as inputs, to the next step of our neural network. The ability to connect previous information to our current task is crucial for making better predictions. For more about how an LSTM neural network works, here is a <a class="w3-text-indigo" href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">website</a>
             for a more detailed explanation.
